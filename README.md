# easyrequirements

This is an easy requirements.txt installer for python/pip.

## Whats the point?
This is an installer that you can put into your projects to allow people to easily install the requirements needed to run a .py file. It can be used in any project, and you can choose where the requirements.txt can be located as well. (Guide in [the wiki](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/easyrequirements/wiki)). Easyrequirements also can incorporate a readme into it so the user can easily select if they want to read it or not. It also allows the user to choose if they even want to install the requirements.

## How do I edit it to make it mine?
Eeverything you need to know is in [the wiki](https://github.com/Wamy-Dev/easyrequirements/wiki).

## Can I use this on linux or mac?
Yes. If on Windows use the .bat version. If on linux or mac use the .sh version.
